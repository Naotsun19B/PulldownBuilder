## Description  

This plugin allows you to easily create a pull-down structure using a dedicated asset.  
For example, you can specify the Row Name of the data table in a pull-down menu like an enum instead of a string.  

![PulldownDetails](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/173223818-c8297c9c-6a0d-4e4a-938d-a15f55df9c49.PNG)

## Requirement  

Target version : UE4.24 ~ 5.3  
Target platform :  Windows, Mac, Linux (Runtime module has no platform restrictions)   

## Installation  

Put the Plugins/PulldownBuilder folder in your project's Plugins folder.  
Or install from the [marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/pulldown-builder).  
If the feature is not available after installing the plugin, it is possible that the plugin has not been enabled, so please check if the plugin is enabled from Edit > Plugins.  

## Usage  

### ・When using C++   

[/Source/PulldownBuilderTest/PulldownBuilderTest.Build.cs](https://github.com/Naotsun19B/PulldownBuilder/blob/3b829357b2c9f013357a3ee30fcdb2b5a913aaf1/Source/PulldownBuilderTest/PulldownBuilderTest.Build.cs#L13)
```
using UnrealBuildTool;

public class PulldownBuilderTest : ModuleRules
{
	public PulldownBuilderTest(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
	{
		PCHUsage = PCHUsageMode.UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs;
	
		PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Core", "CoreUObject", "Engine", "InputCore" });

		PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "PulldownStruct" });
	}
}
```
First, we will use the structure included in the runtime module([`PulldownStruct`](https://github.com/Naotsun19B/PulldownBuilder/tree/master/Plugins/PulldownBuilder/Source/PulldownStruct)), so add it to the dependent module in [Project].Build.cs.  

[/Source/PulldownBuilderTest/TestPulldown.h](https://github.com/Naotsun19B/PulldownBuilder/blob/master/Source/PulldownBuilderTest/TestPulldown.h)
```
#pragma once

#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "PulldownStructBase.h"
#include "TestPulldown.generated.h"

USTRUCT(BlueprintType)
struct FTestPulldown : public FPulldownStructBase
{
	GENERATED_BODY()

public:
	UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditAnywhere)
	int32 TestInt;

	UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditAnywhere)
	FString TestString;
};

USTRUCT(BlueprintType)
struct FTestPulldown2 : public FPulldownStructBase
{
	GENERATED_BODY()
};
```
Next, define a structure that inherits from [`FPulldownStructBase`](https://github.com/Naotsun19B/PulldownBuilder/blob/master/Plugins/PulldownBuilder/Source/PulldownStruct/Public/PulldownStruct/PulldownStructBase.h) included in the runtime module([`PulldownStruct`](https://github.com/Naotsun19B/PulldownBuilder/tree/master/Plugins/PulldownBuilder/Source/PulldownStruct)).
You can define variables in addition to the string selected in the pull-down menu.  
The structure defined here is the structure for which the pull-down menu is displayed.  

![CreatePulldownContents](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/173223842-a5356544-b7ee-4979-9864-36986ee358ec.PNG)

Then build, launch the editor, and create a PulldownContents asset in the Content Browser.  

![PulldownStructType](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/173223858-12fca014-5fb8-44b1-bbce-1d07c363edde.PNG)

Open the created asset and set `Pulldown Struct Type` to the structure defined earlier.    
You can't set the same structure for multiple PulldownContents assets.  

![PulldownListGenerator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/173223874-23a8d64b-545d-4fb4-8b89-b163a93df5fc.PNG)

Next, set the class that builds the list from which the pull-down menu is based.    
See the `Pulldown List Generator` section below for the classes that build lists.    

![Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/173223882-b88eba54-db31-4282-8b57-aa49f4ac4c1b.PNG)

With the settings up to this point, you can see the pull-down menu built by this PulldownContents asset in `Preview`.  
After that, if you use a structure defined by variables or function arguments, the pull-down menu will be displayed automatically.  

![PulldownPin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/173223894-288dc7c3-ca0b-47dc-b0c9-97e7999f6460.PNG)
![PulldownDetails](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/173223818-c8297c9c-6a0d-4e4a-938d-a15f55df9c49.PNG)

### ・When don't using C++  

![CreatePulldownContents](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/173223842-a5356544-b7ee-4979-9864-36986ee358ec.PNG)

First, create a PulldownContents asset in the Content Browser.  

![PulldownListGenerator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/173223874-23a8d64b-545d-4fb4-8b89-b163a93df5fc.PNG)

Next, set the class that builds the list from which the pull-down menu is based.  
See the `PulldownListGenerator` section below for the classes that build lists.   

![Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/173223882-b88eba54-db31-4282-8b57-aa49f4ac4c1b.PNG)

With the settings up to this point, you can see the pull-down menu built by this PulldownContents asset in `Preview`.  
After that, if you use `NativeLessPulldownStruct` for variables and function arguments, the pull-down menu will be displayed automatically.  
Unlike the one defined in C++, you can switch the PulldownContents asset from which the pull-down menu is based.  

![NativeLessPin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/173223970-d3d8e7e5-3f1c-4d9f-9293-71cdc35ebbe7.PNG)

### ・PulldownListGenerator  

There is `PulldownListGenerator` as a class that builds the list that is the basis of the pull-down menu.
The following three `PulldownListGenerator`s are provided as standard.

|             **Class**              | **Function**                                                                                            | **Tooltip**                                                                                                                                  |
|:----------------------------------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   DataTablePulldownListGenerator   | List the Row Names of the data table assets set in `SourceDataTable` in the pull-down menu.             | If there is a variable named "PulldownTooltip" of type FString in the structure used as the row of the Data Table, that string is displayed. |
|  StringTablePulldownListGenerator  | List the Keys of the string table assets set in `SourceStringTable` in the pull-down menu.              | Displays the corresponding character string for each item.                                                                                   |
|   NameArrayPulldownListGenerator   | List the elements of the array in the pull-down menu under `SourceNameArray`.                           | Displays the character string set in the Value of each item.                                                                                 |
| InputMappingsPulldownListGenerator | List the elements of the input mapping set in the input of the project settings in the pull-down menu.  | Displays the name of the button corresponding to the input name.                                                                             |

To create your own `PulldownListGenerator`, inherit the [`UPulldownListGeneratorBase`](https://github.com/Naotsun19B/PulldownBuilder/blob/master/Plugins/PulldownBuilder/Source/PulldownBuilder/Public/PulldownBuilder/ListGenerators/PulldownListGeneratorBase.h) in C++ or BP and override the `GetPulldownRows`.  
The return value array will be listed in the pull-down menu.  
Since the object with the variable being edited and the variable being edited are passed as arguments, the contents of the list generated based on it can be changed.  

![BP_TestPulldown4PulldownListGenerator-GetPulldownRowsFromBlueprint](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/177553308-a277f778-67d1-41aa-8495-2cba434ed423.png)

### ・RowNameUpdater  

If the underlying data of the pull-down menu is updated (for example, the Row Name of the data table has changed), there is a mechanism to replace the already used value with the new name.  
The following assets are supported as standard.

| **Asset type** | **Updater class**                                                                                                                                                                            |
|:--------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   Blueprint    | [`UBlueprintUpdater`](https://github.com/Naotsun19B/PulldownBuilder/blob/master/Plugins/PulldownBuilder/Source/PulldownBuilder/Private/PulldownBuilder/RowNameUpdaters/BlueprintUpdater.h)   |
|   DataTable    | [`UDataTableUpdater`](https://github.com/Naotsun19B/PulldownBuilder/blob/master/Plugins/PulldownBuilder/Source/PulldownBuilder/Private/PulldownBuilder/RowNameUpdaters/DataTableUpdater.h)   |
|   DataAsset    | [`UDataAssetUpdater`](https://github.com/Naotsun19B/PulldownBuilder/blob/master/Plugins/PulldownBuilder/Source/PulldownBuilder/Private/PulldownBuilder/RowNameUpdaters/DataAssetUpdater.h)   |

In order to support assets other than these, it is necessary to inherit [`URowNameUpdaterBase`](https://github.com/Naotsun19B/PulldownBuilder/blob/master/Plugins/PulldownBuilder/Source/PulldownBuilder/Public/PulldownBuilder/RowNameUpdaters/RowNameUpdaterBase.h) in C ++ and implement the update process.

### ・Nodes

![CompareNodes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/223067854-f48de6a1-9766-4bdb-ad28-6944a9c86913.PNG)

Nodes is available that compares pull-down structures of the same type.  
If the comparison target is `NativeLessPulldownStruct`, you can set whether to also compare `Pulldown Source` of `NativeLessPulldownStruct` when comparing with `Strict Comparison` property from node details panel.  

![SwitchNodes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/223068042-7e42c339-aa07-4c57-bda1-9f8fe0d4665a.PNG)

Switch nodes is available that consists of the items that appear in the pull-down menu of the pull-down structure.  
If the target pulldown structure is `NativeLessPulldownStruct`, the property `Pulldown Contents` from the node details panel allows you to select the asset that the node's pin items are based on.    
Also, if the target pulldown structure is `Native Less Pulldown Struct` and a value that is not one of the items is passed, it will be output to the default pin.  

## Settings  

![EditorPreferences](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51815450/173224011-f82601a7-77e8-45fb-b74a-31ca17464163.PNG)

The items that can be set from the editor preferences are as follows.

| **Section** | **Item**                                   | **Description**                                                                                                 |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Appearance  | Panel Size                                 | Specifies the panel size of the pull-down menu.                                                                 |
|             | Is Select when Double Click                | If this flag is true, you will need to double-click to select an item in the pull-down menu.                    |
|             | Should Inline Display When Single Property | If this flag is true, automatically inline a single property pull-down structure.                               |
|             | Notification Severity                      | Specifies the severity to focus the message log of notifications issued by this plugin.                         |
| Redirect    | Should Update When Source Row Name Changed | Specifies whether to perform automatic update processing of the pull-down menu using RowNameUpdater.            |
|             | Active Row Name Updater                    | Specifies the RowNameUpdater class to enable. Only the RowNameUpdater set here will perform the update process. |

## Note  

・The PulldownContents asset is an editor-only asset and will not be cooked into the package.
